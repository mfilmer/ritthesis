% This class inherits from the LaTeX standard report class and should support
% many of the options supported by it, as well as a few extra. These extra
% options are described here.
%
% By default the document uses doublespacing, if this is unsedired, these
% options are provided:
% singlespacing, onehalfspacing, doublespacing
%
% By default the lists: table of contents, list of figures, list of tables and
% list of symbols (toc, lof, lot, los) use onehalfspacing. This can
% be overridden with the options:
% singlespacelists, onehalfspacelists, doublespacelists
% If different spacing is desired for different lists, the following macros can
% be redefined t set up the desired spacing:
% \@tocspacing, \@lofspacing, \@lotspacing, \@losspacing
% For example:
% \renewcommand*\@lofspacing\singlespacing
% Will set single spacing on the list of figures, and the remaining lists will
% use whatever was set by the class options, or the default.
%
% If the microsystems title page and signature sheet should be used:
% microsys
%
% The bibliography is single spaced by default. If this is undesired, these
% options will change the bibliography spacing:
% singlespacebib, onehalfspacebib, doublespacebib
%
% Most pages, other than the first page of a chapter or a list, or a special
% page, such as the signature sheet, have a header showing the current chapter
% name. This may be undesired, and can be removed with the option:
% nohead
%
% Page numbers are located in the bottom right corner of the page. If instead
% they should be centered, this option will do so:
% pagenumcenter
%
% This class can also be used to write a proposal. When doing so, the top level
% sectioning elements are sections rather than chapters, and the document is
% centered on the page, rather than offset for binding as the thesis is. The
% proposal formatting can be achieved with the option:
% proposal
%
% In order to create a buildable document, you first must include a lot of
% information about your school and program, much of this information can be
% automatically included by using one or more of the following options:
% ms, phd, microe, microsys, rit
%
% If using either 'microe', 'cmpe' or 'microsys', then none of the other options
% should be necessary. However, if using either the 'ms', or the 'phd' option,
% 'rit' is likely a desired option as well
%

\documentclass[microe]{ritthesis}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Packages %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Used for filler text but will almost certainly be of no use in a real thesis
\usepackage{lipsum}
% Generally you will want to use the graphicx package to display images
\usepackage{graphicx}
% You can set the graphicspath if you want to use pictures no in the same
% directory as the .tex file
%\graphicspath{{images/}}

% If subfigures or subtables are desires, the subcaption package is the
% recommended way to go. This package should not be used unless subfigures or
% subtables (or any other functionality it provides) is desired. It will not
% work if the subfig package is used.
%\usepackage{subfig}
\usepackage{subcaption}

% Use these commands to set up the author, title, and date
\author{Matthew J. Filmer}
% You most likely need to insert a line break or two to make the title wrap
% more evenly
\title{A \LaTeX{} Document Class for a Masters Thesis\\in Microelectronic Engineering at RIT}
\date{June 23, 2014}

% You can further customize the appearance of the title and author by
% uncommenting and changing:
% \makeatletter
% \renewcommand{\thetitle}{\textbf{\large\@title}}
% \renewcommand{\theauthor}{\textsc{\@author}}
% \makeatother
% But I like small caps, so that is how I made it

% There are also a bunch of other commands that can be changed, were this not
% a masters thesis in microelectronic engineering at RIT. Those would be the
% following:
% \renewcommand*{\universityname}{Rochester Institute of Technology}
% \renewcommand*{\collegename}{Kate Gleason College of Engineering}
% \renewcommand*{\departmentname}{Department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering}
% \renewcommand*{\logo}{kgcoelogohoriz}
% \renewcommand*{\degreename}{Master of Science}
% \renewcommand*{\degreefield}{Microelectronic Engineering}
% Some or all of these may be set by a class option such as 'microe', 'rit', or
% 'phd' and are therefore not required in every document.

% Each of these commands can be repeated as many times as necessary
% Used to create the lines on the signature sheet. There is an optional first
% argument for each of these to specify title (the default is Dr.)
\advisor{Assistant Professor}{Joe}{Smith}
\committee{Professor}{Thomas}{Thomas}{}
\committee{Dean of the College}{Philip}{Jones}{}
%\committee[Mr.]{Bystander}{Robert}{van Rosenson XXXVIII}{King of the Committee}

% If you want a second "Certified By" section
\certifiedby[Mr.]{Bystander}{Robert}{van Rosenson XXXVIII}{King of the Committee}
\certifiedby[Mr.]{Bystander}{Robert}{van Rosenson XXXVIII}{King of the Committee}

\renewcommand\certificationmessage{Here you can insert a certification message. Perhaps something along the lines of ``We the undersigned committee members certify that the student has completed the requirements.'' But you should probably make it sounds better than that.}

% You can customize the signature line by redefinding the following:
% \renewcommand*\@siglinelength\linewidth
% \setlength\@siglineheight{1pt}

% This command makes testing the proposal option easier
% it should not be used in a real document
% It just redefines \chapter to be the same as \section
\providecommand{\chapter}[1]{\section{#1}}

% Begin the document, the way you always do in LaTeX
\begin{document}
	
% This starts the pages that get roman numerals at the beginning of the
% document. Generally is the first thing in the document.
\frontmatter

% Instead of \frontmatter it is possible to do what that macro does
% manually, if more control was desired. If that is the case, uncomment and
% change, or just use the individual macros:
% \renewcommand{\frontmatter}{\pagenumbering{roman}\maketitlepage\makesignaturepage}
% Each of these commands can also be changed, but for details on that you
% should look in ritthesis.cls to see how they are defined

% The following three environments are optional and can be included in any
% order. Each of these environments has an optional argument to either include
% or suppress inclusion of the environment in the table of contents. Simply use
% either 'n' or 'y' to suppress the entry, or include the entry, in the toc.
% By default, only the abstract is included in the toc.

% The acknowledgments environment will create an acknowledgments section,
% complete with a correctly spelled title. Change the following to rename
%\renewcommand{\acknowledgmentsname}{Acknowledgments}
\begin{acknowledgments}
\lipsum[4-6]
\end{acknowledgments}

% The dedication environment will create a dedication section, change the
% following to rename
%\renewcommand{\dedicationname}{Dedication}
\begin{dedication}
\lipsum[7]
\end{dedication}

% The abstract environment is very similar to the acknowledgments environment
% and is used the same. Change the following to rename
%\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
\lipsum[1-2]
\end{abstract}

% Makes the table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables, in that
% order. This command makes a table of contents entry for each of these lists
\makealllists

% Here you can generate a list of symbols, or a list of abbreviations, or whatever
% other custom lists you may desire. These lists are built using the longtable
% environment, and takes similar arguments
% You can change the list of symbols name by either uncommenting the following line
% and making the desired change, or by providing the optional argument to the
% listofsymbols environment
%\renewcommand{\listofsymbname}{List of Symbols}
% The first argument is column alignment options and uses the same syntax as the
% argument for the longtable environment (which is similar to the tabular environment)
% The second argument is the column headers, separated by ailgnment characters (&)
% If you want multiple extra tables, such as a table of acronyms, and a table of symbols
% you can just use this environment multiple times, with different names

% The \mainmatter macro starts the main matter. This starts arabic numbering,
% and adds a header (except on the first page of a chapter).
\mainmatter

% This class uses the fancyhdr package to build the headers. You could probably
% customize the headers by changing the plain page style, as well as the fancy
% page style. There is no guarantee anything you do works though. (In fact,
% there isn't a guarantee anything in ritthesis.cls works.)

% Likewise, the chapter and section headers are formatted using the titlesec
% package. You should be able to customize them by using that package's
% commands, specifically \titleformat

% Begin new chapters the way you always do it LaTeX
\chapter{Doing things the hard way}

% Same goes for sections
\section{First sections aren't as much fun as first comments}
The first paragraph in a chapter\footnote{and probably section} is not indented. I can probably change this, but it is the \LaTeX{} default. Here is an example of an equation, it is numbered within the chapter.

% Equations are numbered within chapters. Typeset them the way you normally do
